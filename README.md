# Toontown-Single-Player
This is a completely remade toontown version without any connections to servers. Its all done on your pc!

This game will be made completely from scratch except for the phase files for TTO
Dont worry the game will be nerfed so its not too hard to play solo but also challenging.


Anyone is welcome to contribute just make a fork of the repo and make a pull request for your change.


To start the game just run start-game.bat on windows or start-game.sh on linux or mac
